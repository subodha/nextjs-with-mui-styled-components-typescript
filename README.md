## The idea behind the example

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps.
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `styled-components`, which is used instead of the default style engine in MUI v5.

## The link component

Next.js has [a custom Link component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link).
The example folder provides adapters for usage with MUI.
More information [in the documentation](https://mui.com/guides/routing/#next-js).

## What's next?

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

You now have a working example project.
You can head back to the documentation, continuing browsing it from the [templates](https://mui.com/getting-started/templates/) section.
